    <h1>Healthy Pizza Recipe</h1>
    <img class="image" src="assets/healthy_pizza.jpg" alt="Pizza">
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p> This pizza uses our easy thin crust pizza dough. It’s made with simple ingredients (flour, olive oil, water) and because it’s thin, it has significantly less calories than a fluffy crust.</p>
    <p>Red sauce brings big flavor without big calories. This one is our easy pizza sauce, a fan-favorite recipe that takes only 5 minutes and tastes like Italy. (Really.)</p>
    <p>This healthy pizza has only ¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese. It’s just enough to bring in a savory flavor, but there’s so much flavor in the veggies and sauce you don’t need to load on cheese.</p>
    <p>This pizza is topped with peppers that are loaded with vitamin C, and leafy green nutrient-dense baby arugula.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball Easy Thin Crust Dough</li>
        <li>½ cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 medium red onion</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup baby arugula</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Make the pizza dough: Follow the <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/easy-thin-crust-pizza-dough/" target="_blank">Easy Thin Crust Pizza Dough</a> recipe to prepare the dough. (This takes about 15 minutes to make and 45 minutes to rest.)</li>
        <li>Place a pizza stone in the oven and preheat to 500°F. OR preheat your pizza oven </li>
        <li>Make the pizza sauce: Make the <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/homemade-easy-pizza-sauce-recipe/" target="_blank">Easy Pizza Sauce</a>.</li>
        <li>Thinly slice the peppers. Thinly slice the red onion. Thinly slice the garlic. In a skillet, add 1 tablespoon olive oil and ¼ teaspoon kosher salt. Saute the vegetables, stirring often, for about 7 to 10 minutes, until browned and very soft. Stir in the oregano and remove from the heat.</li>
        <li>When the oven is ready, dust a pizza peel with cornmeal or semolina flour. (If you don’t have a pizza peel, you can use a rimless baking sheet or the back of a rimmed baking sheet. But a pizza peel is well worth the investment!) Stretch the dough into a circle; see <a href="https://www.acouplecooks.com/how-to-stretch-pizza-dough/" target="_blank">How to Stretch Pizza Dough</a> for instructions. Then gently place the dough onto the pizza peel.</li>
        <li>Spread the pizza sauce over the dough using the back of a spoon to create a thin layer. Sprinkle with the vegetables, drained capers, and Parmesan cheese.</li>
        <li>Use the pizza peel to carefully transfer the pizza onto the preheated pizza stone. Bake the pizza until the cheese and crust are nicely browned, about 5 to 7 minutes in the oven (or 1 minute in a pizza oven).</li>
        <li>While the pizza is baking, mix the baby arugula with a drizzle of olive oil and a pinch of kosher salt. When the pizza is done, top with the arugula. Slice into pieces and serve immediately.</li>
