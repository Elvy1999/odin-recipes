    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>No Bake </strong>– No heating up the house, and only takes 10 minutes to throw the ingredients together and put in the fridge.</p>
    <p><strong>Healthy</strong> – Nothing artificial here. These bars are filled with normal pantry ingredients and sweetened with honey.</p>
    <p><strong>Taste Delicious</strong> – I’ve had one to many unappetizing protein bars in my life, so I’m all about making them from scratch, with ingredients I recognize, and they taste wonderful!</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 ball Easy Thin Crust Dough</li>
        <li>½ cup Easy Pizza Sauce</li>
        <li>1/2 yellow bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/2 red bell pepper</li>
        <li>1/4 medium red onion</li>
        <li>1 garlic clove</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon olive oil</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon dried oregano, plus more for garnish</li>
        <li>½ tablespoon capers, drained</li>
        <li>¼ cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
        <li>½ cup baby arugula</li>
        <li>Kosher salt</li>
        <li>Olive oil</li>
        <li>Semolina flour or cornmeal, for dusting the pizza peel</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix all ingredients until well combined. Press into an 11×7 inch pan (or similar size—you could use a 9×13 pan, but not press them all the way to one side). Refrigerate for at least 1 hour before cutting into bars.</li>
        <li>Before cutting, press them down and together tightly. Store bars in an airtight container in the fridge for up to 2 weeks.</li>
    </ol>
